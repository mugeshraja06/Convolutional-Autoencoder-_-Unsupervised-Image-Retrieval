Convolutional Autoencoder _  Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

### dataset
dataset of ~5k 512x512 images, your program should accept an 512x512 input image and return N images from the provided dataset similar to the input image.

I have shared the basic code for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which will return N images from the provided dataset similar to the input image.
